    # This is a description of a table that is organized by extending inner tables in a recursive manner.
    # The inner table is a composite resource named dim3 that contains three attributes named column1, column2 and column3.
    # The outer table is designated by the resource dim4 that keeps its own values and also includes the list of resources dim3
    # where each entry in the list can be thought of as a row in the table.
