# Agents is the main section of the specification that describes the functionality of agents. Each agent is identified by its unique name,
# so the key Agents contains a list of agent names. Each agent can be in one or more states and each state is associated with one behavior.
# An agent can be a Producer if it creates messages that are put into channels, a Consumer if it receives and processes messages or both.
# Some Producers may be designated as Sources that are the entry points in the simulation or Sinks as they are collectors of measurements.
# For each state name key the value is the object whose key is the name of the associated behavior and the value of this key is the next
# state name to switch to or null or no value at all, which will make the value of the key state name the behavior with no state to switch to.
