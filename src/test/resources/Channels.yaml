Agents:
  Channels: # a channel can be connected to agents or groups
    # unidirectional channels trasmit specific messages from its sources to the destination agents.
    # a channel transforms messages while delivering them to destinations.
    # a channel does not change the topology of the system - it does not create or delete agents, it operates on messages and resources only
