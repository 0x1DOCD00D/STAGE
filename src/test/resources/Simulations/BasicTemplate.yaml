Agents: # an agent represents an entity in a simulation that performs actions and communicates with other agents
        # by sending and receiving messages. An agent is defined by its unique name.
  Groups: # an abstraction that represents a logical collection of agents based on some comprehension
  Behaviors: #each agent can be assigned one or more behaviors which are invoked in response to messages
  Channels: #a channel is represented by some agent that adds behavior to message transmission
            #a channel connects agents via some other agents, if any thus creating a path.
  Resources: # resources exist within agents and behaviors access and manipulate resources.
Messages: # data structures that agents use to communicate with one another using the simulation runtime
Models: # a model defines the inputs to agents and how simulation agents are connected in a graph
