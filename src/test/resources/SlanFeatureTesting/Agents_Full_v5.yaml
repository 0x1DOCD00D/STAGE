# in some simulations it is important to create probabilistic state transitions
# where an agent can switch to some other state with some probability. For example,
# an agent named Professor can switch to the following states after having been in the
# state of writing a paper: Sleep, Die, TeachClass, Eat, Travel. In addition,
Agents:
  Agent Name X:
    null: #this is the initial state
      Some default behavior and then: [ State A: 0.1, State B: 0.6, State X: somePdfGenerator]
    State A: [ stateAbehavior: [ State A: 0.01, State B: 0.3, State X: somePdfGenerator] ]
    State B:
      Respond to messages A and Y: State X
    State X:
      Spawn Agent Y: null
